# Python-Projects
*Small Python projects to practise new learnings*  

The first project to practise certain new functions I learned was the PDF to MP3 converter I built.
It converts any PDF file into an MP3 file, which can become useful if I do not want to read certain files but listen to the content it provides (e.g. while cooking etc.).
